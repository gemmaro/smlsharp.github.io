title: "Relicensing to MIT license"
translated: true
---

In agreement with Tohoku University on March 25, 2021, we (the SML#
development team) have decided to relicense the SML# software.

From now on (the current revision of the bleeding edge), the SML# software
will be distributed under the MIT license copyrighted by the SML# development
team. See [LICENSE file] for the current license.
Note that the past releases (3.7.1 and prior) are not relicensed;
the same as before, they are distributed under 3-clause BSD license
copyrighted by Tohoku University.

We believe that this change makes it easier for people other than Tohoku
University to join the SML# project as an open-source software project.
We also believe that the MIT license, which does not contain
the binary redistribution clause, allows the users to use SML# more
freely.
