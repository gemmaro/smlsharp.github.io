We are pleased to announce that we have completed migration to GitHub!

From now on, we will develop SML# by using public repositories on GitHub and
offer information from this website (GitHub Pages).
We will use GitHub Issues, Pull requests, and Discussions as the primary
channel for communiction between developers and users.
See the [development] page for details.
The [previous website] and mail address we used are still available for a while.

During the migration process, we made "force push" over and over again.
If you forked or cloned a repository in the [smlsharp organization] before
6 Apr 2021, please fork or clone again.
