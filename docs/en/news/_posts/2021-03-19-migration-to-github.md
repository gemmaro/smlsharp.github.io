We are going to migrate to GitHub. All resources related to SML#,
including website and repositories, will be moved to GitHub.

By the migration to GitHub, we are expecting that developers and users
can communicate each other more actively and consequently SML# community
would be more developed.
After the migration is completed,
we will use GitHub as a primary channel of SML# development.
Of course, we will repond to issues and pull requests.

* SML# project on GitHub: [https://github.com/smlsharp](https://github.com/smlsharp)

Formerly, smlsharp organization on GitHub was maintained as an unofficial
site by volunteers.  From now on, it will become an official organization
managed by SML# development team.  We sincerely appreciate the volunteers'
effort of maintaining the smlsharp organization.
