# SML# Project Website

This is the source of the SML# project website.  The website is
generated by Jekyll.  When pushing some modification to GitHub,
Jekyll runs automatically and then the website is published.

To check your modification locally on your PC before committing and
pushing it, set up Jekyll in your working directory by the following
steps:

1. Install Bundler (version 2 or later) by the package management
   system of your OS.  This operation usually requires superuser
   privilege.

2. Install Jekyll in your working directory by the following commands:

       bundle config set --local path vendor/bundle
       bundle install

After Jekyll is installed, launch Jekyll's local web server by
the following command and access to `http://localhost:4000` by
your web browser:

    bundle exec jekyll serve -s docs
